	<p>A computer, has inside of it, a world of possibility. </p>
	<p>We all understand the value computers have in our life. It is why we use them so much on a daily basis.</p>
	<p>In a world where computers are so common, it is disappointing to see such few users taking the step to understand their machines at a deeper level.
	As a self taught programmer, I realise learning about software and the inner workings of computers can be daunting, but the reward of reduced friction between you and your machine is a lifelong benefit that is too good to ignore.
	The objective of this website is to explore the inner workings of computers, from a software perspective, and provide useful insights that are aimed at improving your experience as you interact with your computer.
	</p>
	<p>In a world where computers and code have a significant impact on our lives, the value of understanding the logic behind these systems is growing ever greater.
	As a self taught programmer, I am all to familiar with patching together solutions using online resources. My intention with this site is to take the knowledge I've gained, and collate it into a more structured learning experience for others.

	This website exists for 2 primary reasons:<br>
	1. To give everyone a deeper insight into the mind of their computer,
	<br>and<br>
	2. To help aspiring programmers hone their craft.<br>
