In a world where computers and code have a significant impact on our lives, the value of understanding the logic behind these systems is growing ever greater.
As a self taught programmer, I am all to familiar with patching together solutions using online resources. My intention with this site is to take the knowledge I've gained, and collate it into a more structured learning experience for others.

This website exists for 2 primary reasons:<br>
1. To give everyone a deeper insight into the mind of their computer,<br>
and<br>
2. To help aspiring programmers hone their craft.<br>
