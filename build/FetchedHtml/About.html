In a world where many of us rely on digital devices, it is surprising how few of us know how they work. Most of the details have been abstracted away. While abstraction is necessary when dealing with complex systems, it does have its down sides.
In my exploration as a self taught programmer, I have delved into the software side of computers. Trying to take a system and reason about its design in a way that satisfies my doubts is a habit of mine. As such, I've pieced together my own personal view of many core system features. I believe this reason based viewpoint may aid others gain a stronger foundational understanding of specific software features and thus I've created this website.
I hope you find some useful information here, in a way that complements what you already know.

In a world where computers and code have a significant impact on our lives, the value of understanding the logic behind these systems is growing ever larger.
In a world where many of us rely on digital devices, can you say you know how they work?
Most software provides a simplified version of its capabilities to the end user, while hiding away the details of its inner workings. This makes the software more approachable for beginners, however, as you become a more advanced user these details may cause you problems. Many of these problems can be remedied with a quick search online, but it is only a matter of time until another one arises.
As a self taught programmer, I am all to familiar with patching together solutions using online resources. My intention with this site is to take the knowledge I've gained, and collate it into a more structured learning experience for others.
