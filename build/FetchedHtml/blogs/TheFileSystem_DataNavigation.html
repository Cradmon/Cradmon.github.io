	<h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p>
	One day I was talking with my colleague Bob, about the best name for a file in our project. I was winning the argument but Bob is not someone who is gracious in defeat. In an attempt to get in one last quip he announced "Do you even know what the File System is?". My fumbling response told Bob everything he needed to know and as our conversation came to a close, we both knew who was victorious.

	As much as I despise losing to Bob, my mind was fixated on failure. My failure to answer such a basic question. When it comes to the File System there is only one way to describe myself. I am an idiot. Although, this is somewhat comforting, I've been an idiot most of my life and as an experienced idiot I know the steps I must take to move forward. So over the next few years I began taking the File System seriously. I finally began answering the questions I used to ignore and when those questions forced me to dive deeper into the File System, that is where I discovered the most impactful knowledge. Over the years my reasoning for decisions I made in the File System became less flimsy, but there was only one way for me to test the progress I had made. I needed Bob to interrogate me. If I could withstand his interrogation and defeat the barrage of questions he would fire at me, I would finally acknowledge I am no longer an idiot.

	As I began talking to Bob, it was easy enough to direct the conversation onto the File System and to start the interrogation. As Bob asked me question after question, and I responded with well thought out responses, it came to my attention that Bob was not as aggressive with his questioning as I thought he would be. It was less like an interrogation and more like a curious mind seeking knowledge. At the end of this conversation Bob had this to say, "Listening to your answers, I'm finally beginning to glimpse the role of the File System. I've never been able to view it in such a well structured manner. I don't know how many people there are out there who've used the File System for years and struggle to answer basic questions surrounding it, but I believe the knowledge you've imparted to me would be greatly appreciated by those individuals. Have you ever thought of creating a blog or a website to share this knowledge?"

	The suggestion that Bob made that day is finally coming to fruition. This series is our beginners guide to understanding the File System. I hope that this knowledge is as fruitful to you as it has been to Bob and myself.

	<h2>What is the File System?</h2>

	<p>
	To define the File System it is best to start with save data. Save data is a feature that we've come to expect from computers. It allows us to keep data around for a longer period of time than would otherwise be possible. In a world void of save data our data would be temporary; you may have some experience of this if you've ever lost data.
	So I hope we can agree that save data is a feature that is worth pursuing. However, in order to provide that feature we need to solve a number of problems. Some of these problems relate to hardware and some relate to software. The most successful solution to the software related problems is built around a core concept we call a file. This is why we call it 'The File System'.
	Hence the File System is software that is necessary if we want to save data. For the most part we trust it, because it has been reliable time and time again. Data corruption isn't something we experience often because the File System ensures our data 
	</p>

	<p>
	The File System wouldn't exist if we didn't have a need to save data.
	It is impossible to define the File System without talking about save data.
	To define the File System let's begin by thinking about how computers save data. For a computer to provide this saving feature it must overcome a number of problems. Some are hardware related and some are software related. If we solve all the software related problems we will end up with a save system, which comprises of those solutions.
	</p>

	<p>
	Lets take a deeper look into how a computer goes about saving data. For us to save data on a computer, hardware problems and software problems need to be solved. The software problems require a combination of solutions, and the File System is one such combination.
	In order to save data on your computer a number of problems need to be solved. Some of those problems are hardware related and some of those problems are software related. The File System is a bunch of solutions to the software related problems we need to overcome in order to save data.

	<h2>What is a File?</h2>

	<p>
	I don't know about you but when I first encountered this question my answer was along the lines of 'a file is a piece/block of data'. While this definition is useful for beginners, it lacks details that more advanced users could use. So I'd like to present a more helpful view of a file.
