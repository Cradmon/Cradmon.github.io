<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Imagine I came along and wiped all of the saved data off of your devices, including any backups; and continuously deleted any data you save in the future. What would it be worth to you, to be able to save data again?</p>
<p>Don't worry, this is not something I would do, but as a thought experiment it highlights the value of a mundane feature we users take for granted.
While saving data is a valuable feature, it necessitates the need to navigate that saved data, which could benefit from the ability to organise that saved data. Although perhaps the most important addition to saving data would be the security features protecting our data, after all we'd want to keep our data loss nightmares at bay. Considering the functionality surrounding saved data we could use a system that handles 'everything saved data'. This is the job of File System.</p>
<p>In essence the File System is the piece of software that makes saving data viable. Its role in providing dependable saving features is valuable to us users, yet it hardly gets any praise and instead gets plenty of flak when it prevents users from taking dangerous actions. The remedy for this situation is to experience what the File System is doing behind the scenes. If you are like me, learning about the File System will create a newfound appreciation and respect for the way it goes about protecting our data.</p>
<p>Of course, I realise that the work a computer does is of lesser concern to us than the work we have to do. So I've decided to focus this series on the organisational aspects of the File System, allowing us to organise our data more effectively. If it also happens to highlight the careful design of the File System, that is just a bonus.</p>

<h2>The Navigational Issue of Growing Data</h2>
<p>To describe this issue, we are going to use 2 examples to aid us:</p>

<h3>Example 1</h3>
<p>Lets say we have a list of files:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Apple.aac</li>
	<li>Pear.png</li>
	<li>Banana.blend</li>
</ul>
<p>and we ask these questions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>is Apple.aac on the list?</li>
	<li>is Cherry.css on the list?</li>
	<li>is Pear.png on the list?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example 2</h3>
<p>Lets say we have a longer list of files:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Apple.aac</li>
	<li>Fig.flac</li>
	<li>Kiwi.kra</li>
	<li>Potato.png</li>
	<li>Banana.blend</li>
	<li>Zucchini.zip</li>
	<li>Strawberry.svg</li>
	<li>Carrot.css</li>
	<li>Squash.svg</li>
	<li>Lettuce.lz</li>
	<li>Broccoli.blend</li>
	<li>Avocado.aac</li>
	<li>Pear.png</li>
	<li>Raspberry.raw</li>
	<li>Mushroom.mov</li>
	<li>Leek.lz</li>
	<li>Peach.png</li>
	<li>Grape.gz</li>
	<li>Celery.css</li>
	<li>Mango.mov</li>
	<li>Spinach.svg</li>
	<li>Cabbage.css</li>
	<li>Cress.css</li>
	<li>Orange.ogg</li>
	<li>Tomato.tiff</li>
	<li>Blueberry.blend</li>
	<li>Cauliflower.css</li>
	<li>Pomegranage.png</li>
</ul>
<p>and we ask these questions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>is Apple.aac on the list?</li>
	<li>is Cherry.css on the list?</li>
	<li>is Pear.png on the list?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you tried the examples, I hope we can agree that Example 1 is <i>easier</i> to complete than Example 2. Yep. Good. Okay, but identifying it as easier is only the first step. To grasp the secrets of <i>easy</i> navigation, we need to figure out what aspects contribute to this difference.</p>

<p>Before we identify some aspects, it helps to have a more precise definition of <i>easy</i> navigation. As it stands, <i>easy</i> navigation could be measured by the speed it takes to navigate the data. While this somewhat represents the changes in navigation, I think there is a more helpful way to measure differences in navigation. I propose, assessing changes in navigation through the lens of how much energy we need to use to complete the task. If we look at our 2 examples, we could take the same amount of time to complete each, which would suggest there is no difference in terms of navigation, however if we view it from the point of energy usage, example 2 will always require the same or more energy to complete. Which makes Example 1 the easier example to complete.</p>

<p>If we look at the examples question by question. The first question, finding Apple.aac is what is called the best case scenario. This is because most of us will navigate lists from the top left and we find Apple.aac immediately as it is the first item. If we compared example 1 and example 2 based on this first question, there would be a minimal difference between them.</p>

<p>Moving on to the second question, finding Cherry.css, we are looking at the worse case scenario. Since Cherry.css is not in the list, we need to check all items to verify it doesn't exist. Comparing the examples, our energy consumption in example 1 is noticeably less than example 2. This question highlights the negative issue we are trying to demonstrate, but as we've seen with question 1, isn't the whole picture.</p>

<p>The last question of the examples, finding Pear.png, is the average case scenario. The item we are looking for is in the middle of the dataset. When we compare our energy usage, we see it resides somewhere in between question 1 and question 2. So we can deduce that the amount of energy we need is dependant on where the data resides in the dataset and the way we choose to navigate the dataset.</p>

<p>I hope these examples give you a clearer picture of where larger datasets have navigational inefficiencies. There is also the issue of us users making a mistake and having to double or triple check ourselves. These mistakes amplify the negative effects we have experienced in these examples, causing us to use more energy that would be better spent elsewhere.</p>

<p>These examples are small in scale, but I hope they demonstrate the issue effectively. I'm sure you have had experiences with much larger datasets that this issue can be observed. If you can relate, you'll agree that as the dataset grows in scale, this issue gets progressively worse. Theoretically, if we ignored this issue and continued to grow our data we would eventually be spending all our energy on navigating our data. Although, before that happens, most of us will have either given up using that data or found a way to improve our situation.</p>
